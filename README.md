# Uncommon Assembly Code Errors

This repository demonstrates some uncommon but potentially problematic errors that can occur in assembly language programming.  These errors are often subtle and can be difficult to debug.

The examples provided showcase:

* **Unaligned Memory Access:**  Accessing memory at addresses that are not properly aligned for the data type being accessed can lead to access violations or unexpected results.
* **Stack Frame Issues:** Incorrect handling of the stack frame (pushing/popping values, setting the base pointer) can cause crashes or corrupted data.
* **Missing Return Statements:** Functions that are supposed to return a value but lack a return instruction will lead to unpredictable program behavior.

Understanding these potential issues is crucial for writing robust and reliable assembly code.
