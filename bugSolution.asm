mov eax, [ebx+4] ; Add error handling here. Check if ebx is properly aligned and the memory location is accessible.
mov ecx, [esi+8] ; Same as above, add checks for alignment and memory validity.

;Another Example
push ebp ; This saves the old base pointer, essential for stack frame maintenance
mov ebp, esp ; This sets up the new base pointer.  Important to execute before any stack variable use.
; ... code that uses stack variables...
mov esp, ebp ; Restore the stack pointer to the old value
pop ebp ; Restore the base pointer

;Fixed missing return statement
; ... function code ... 
ret ; Added the necessary return instruction.
